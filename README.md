# DenseCLIP in 2023
This is a modified version of the original DenseCLIP, which is hard to implement now due to frequent updates of the openmmlab codebase. This version is compatible with mmsegmentation 0.30.0 and mmcv-full 1.7.1. 

The basic cmd line needed to create the environment is shown in [cmd.txt](https://github.com/zhaozh10/DenseCLIP/blob/master/cmd.txt)
